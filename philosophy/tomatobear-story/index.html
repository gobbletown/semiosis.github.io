<h2 id="origins">Origins</h2>
<p>People have an invariant form. i have an
identity i want to protect from others that
tell me how to think and act, what to believe
and not believe. but take away the external
influences or overcome personal anxiety and
become more self affirming to find your
invariant. a message or advice to a person is
transfromative if they take it to heart. it
may be the thing that polishes a diamond but
could corrode a fossil. the invariant of a
fossil isn‚Äôt the need for carbon atoms as is a
diamond, but rather its beautiful shape which
retains the image of what it represents.</p>
<p>so people have an an identity they should
protect.</p>
<p>my memories of the past in some sense, even
the early ones are more crystalised and easier
to recall because they are my identity now but
i still consider myself to have an identity
beyond just being a collection of memories.</p>
<p>but part of my memory me i guess is always
feeling loved.</p>
<p>and i was clothed as i walked out the door
into adulthood.</p>
<p>only like after going to uni had i kinda
started to get disillusioned.</p>
<p>if i take this allegory and apply it to my
parents and ancestors i have to give weight to
messages from the past and i don‚Äôt want to
lose my clothes/identity i have been endowed
with.</p>
<p>people are created to create and to break
walls.</p>
<p>with the tomato bear story i was thinking of
going from a place where they had lost their
identity to one where they find it again.</p>
<p>i also wanted to talk about the telos, which
is the potential form they are designed to
reach.</p>
<p>the past designed the present form to get to
the future, but i wanted to talk about how the
telos is like a purpose, which a person
discovers and wants to prove to the world as a
means of personal vindication and giving glory
to the designer.</p>

<ul>
<li>avoid allegory and generalisation?</li>
</ul>
<p>A tomato is nothing by itself. It needs a bear.</p>
<p>The tomato bear lives in a world of fake plants. It wasn&rsquo;t always that way.</p>
<p>There was a time when a bears learned to care for the plants and plant,
hedgehog and snail would live in harmony.</p>
<p>The tomato bear is the bearer of a real plant.
Real plants can philosophize.
Real plants have a telos.
he full potential or inherent purpose or objective of a person or thing, similar to the notion of an &lsquo;end goal&rsquo; or &lsquo;raison d&rsquo;√™tre&rsquo;. Moreover, it can be understood as the &ldquo;supreme end of man&rsquo;s endeavour.&rdquo;
A real plant dreams of being a plant to its fullest potential and that means &hellip;
Aside from growing into a fully grown plant, a real plant &hellip;
Fake plants</p>
<p>The tomato bear is the bearer of a tomato&hellip; what is special about the tomato over other plants?
The tomato bear</p>
<p>Bears are smaller than tomatoes
The tomato bear comes from a small village of bears
The tomato bear has allowed</p>
<p>There are different types of tomato bears.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cherry tomato</li>
<li>Big tomato</li>
</ul>
<p>Cherry tomatoes</p>
<p>An evil creature that created the virus that kills tomatoes. The nihilist
The bear is able to keep the tomato alive.
And in keeping the tomato alive, also its philosophy</p>
<p>The mushroom people have a mushroom on their heads.
They are not baddies, but each type of plant has a different philosophy and the mushrooms are very different.</p>
<p>The mushroom people and mushroom land.</p>
<p>All plants are good but some of them have
fallen under the influence of the nihilist
philosophy and they don&rsquo;t believe as they once
did and so have started to impose their own
philosophy onto others?</p>
<p>The big tomato believes its telos is not to be made into ketchup? &ndash; maybe this is too comical
The big tomato is very old and wise.</p>
<p>The big tomato&rsquo;s philosophy</p>
<p>Bears are very bearish.</p>
<p>It has caused the cherry tomatoes that once grew in bunches on the ground to divide against themselves.</p>
<p>Fake plants are a lot like fake</p>
<ul>
<li>grapes</li>
<li>flowers</li>
</ul>
<p>They no longer interact with anything.</p>
<p>The tomato bear visits the bees.
The bees are about 1/4 the size of the tomato bear and live at the twin hives.</p>
