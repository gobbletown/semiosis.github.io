<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In recent times I have been confronted with a
bit of an ontological crisis.</p>
<p>Normal life and social rules cease to delude
me now with its doctrine of right and wrong
and cease to have an oppressing hold on my
life.</p>
<p>However, through new eyes, and being somebody
who interprets and seeks meaning, and to
derive meaning in the things that I do, I now
have to ascribe events, circumstances and
incongruencies with explanation.</p>
<p>Lies that are prevalent may oppress and
prevent a person from glorifying and honoring
God. Because God created us with a telos; a
purpose. A seed grows into a flower, but for
what purpose? What is the purpose of a person?
Certainly not to hide within their shell,
unable to bravely confront what they believe
is true and imprint that truth upon the world.</p>
<p>For instance, God created us with unique gifts
and purposes but there is a thick veil of lies
(mainly intellectual) that a person has to
fight through, and until then believes about
themselves. Those lies will actually prevent
them from performing even the smallest of
steps towards freedom, and will twist good
things into bad things.</p>
<p>Near the beginning of 2021 I have encountered
my greatest fear. Against everybody around me
&ndash; not a single soul would encourage me. I&rsquo;ve
continued on that path. I could only do it
with a strong belief in God&rsquo;s validation.
There was a single moment and afterwards, my
heart went from twisted and in pain to a
feeling of being at least twice the size and
utterly rushing with the feeling of being
loved, and my life from stagnant an inhibited
to a feeling of endless freedom and
exploration of things beyond this fictional
and invisible wall.</p>
<p>Lies oppress and control, they destroy and
lead to death; spiritual, mental and physical.</p>
<p>This is what Billy Graham is talking about in
the video when he says:</p>

<h3 id="a-warning-against-witchcraft">A warning against witchcraft</h3>
<p>California schoolteacher the mother of six
children was kidnapped sometime ago by five
drug addicts; she was stabbed twenty times in
the back. Her captors told the police that
they were warlocks (i.e., male witches) that
they worship the devil.</p>
<p>In Montana some time ago, a 22-year-old
social worker picked up a hitchhiker near
Yellowstone National Park, and the hitchhiker
then shot his victim in the head and brutally
attacked the dead body, telling the police
that he worshipped the devil.</p>
<p>In Miami Beach a 69-year-old retired woman is
viciously attacked by a young woman who later
tells reporters very happily that for the
last five years she has been worshiping Satan
and this is her sacrifice to the devil</p>
<p>Story after story after story like that could
be told tonight if we only had time to tell
it. The scripture has a great deal to say
about the evil and demons, in fact, the whole
Bible is the story of a conflict between the
forces of God and the forces of the devil.
The scripture I would like for you to turn to
is Deuteronomy 18:10‚Äì11.</p>

<p>You remember the story of Saul, who broke the
law of God; he had lost contact with God. God
had left no more blessings upon Saul, the
great king of Israel, and so he decided that
he was going to consult a medium and try to
get a message from Samuel. He consulted the
medium and he was successful in talking
briefly with Samuel but he was killed shortly
thereafter as the judgment of God fell upon
Saul and his family.</p>
<p>Now Americans at this hour are vacillating,
according to the latest polls. Some deny the
existence of the devil altogether, but others
have an unnatural fascination with the devil
and with demons and with exorcism and other
things in the occult, and because of the
success of the Exorcist in many new films
being made on the subject of the devil and
evil right now, a pastor who saw one of these
films said recently, ‚ÄúIt was obnoxious,
repulsive, and disgusting. Pornographic and
obscene.‚Äù</p>
<p>I myself have not seen any of these films. I
don&rsquo;t intend to expose myself to this type of
thing, but a Jesuit priest who saw one of
these films said in his survey among
university students that most students that
have seen the films wish they had never seen
them.</p>
<p>Now this is not a phenomenon just in the
United States; it&rsquo;s also in Germany, where
there are thousands of witches; it&rsquo;s also in
the UK, where the other day our British
bishop said that Great Britain is turning to
black magic as their interest in Christianity
declines; I believe that one of the problems
in the world today that isn&rsquo;t recognized is
the great intensification and acceleration of
evil in the world at this moment because the
devil knows his time is short; the coming of
the Lord Jesus Christ may be drawing near,
and the Scripture teaches that as the coming
of the Lord draws near the activity of the
devil will intensify.</p>
<p>The kidnapping, violence, and terror all over
the world, I believe, is a part of demonic
activity. One authority says that witchcraft
is growing faster than any other religion in
the Western world, and one reason I think that
young people get involved is because it does
get them involved. It&rsquo;s a return to nature,
in a sense, of worship of the natural gods,
finding some power within themselves or
broadening their minds.</p>
<p>Some of them through drugs and some without
drugs, but thousands of young and old alike
are dabbling in their cult at this moment.
Shops in our cities are selling all types of
things that go along with their cult; one
university professor said some time ago that
there were dozens of covens on their campus.
Now, a coven as you know is a circle of
witches and warlocks and warlocks on male
witches numbering 13; they always number 13
and they have their rights and their rituals
and their literature and their witchcraft.</p>
<h3 id="the-father-of-fakery--the-deceiver">The father of fakery (the deceiver)</h3>
<p>Now what is right and what is wrong? What is
false and what is true? The Bible has a lot to
say about it, and I&rsquo;m going to cover a big
subject in a very few minutes.</p>
<p>First, the Bible teaches that there is a
devil.</p>
<p>We meet him in the third chapter of Genesis,
and we don&rsquo;t get rid of him till the end of
the book of Revelation.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s all the way through the Bible, and in
the Bible we find that he&rsquo;s a person.</p>
<p>He walks, he talks. He tempts, he lies. He
flatters. He kills. He works miracles. He
counterfeits. He oppresses. He afflicts. He
influences. He destroys. He quotes and
misquotes scripture. He possesses. He
inflicts bodily injury. He sells discord in
the church. He spreads false doctrine.</p>
<p>Those are the things that this personality in
the Bible called the devil does according to
the scriptures.</p>
<p>Now in the Bible he is called Satan, he is
called the Devil, he is called the fallen
angel, he is called a roaring lion, he is
called the prince of demons, he is called a
wolf a prowler, Beelzebub, the dragon, the
serpent, Lucifer, a great light, a star, a
betrayer, an adversary, a wonder worker, a
liar, the father of lies, the god of this
world, the prince of this world, and the
prince of the power of the air.</p>
<p>It is described in the Bible as:</p>
<ul>
<li>the kingdom of darkness,</li>
<li>the kingdom of evil,</li>
<li>the kingdom of unrighteousness,</li>
<li>the kingdom of hatred,</li>
<li>sin, death, hell, and the grave.</li>
</ul>
<p>He produces false miracles, spiritual
experiences, tongues, and, as the Bible says
about the devil, he has a false church, a
false gospel, a false plan of salvation, a
false trinity, false preachers, false
prophets.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the Bible says about the devil.</p>
<p>The word ‚ÄúLucifer‚Äù means ‚Äúlight-bearer‚Äù or
‚Äúlight-bringer.‚Äù It is a deceptive light
because it is not the true light.</p>
<p>It is a deceptive light. It is not the true
light.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>He promises:</p>
<ul>
<li>freedom,</li>
<li>life, and</li>
<li>liberty, but</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>he produces only:</p>
<ul>
<li>sorrow,</li>
<li>slavery, and</li>
<li>death.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>He&rsquo;s a deceiver and he is trying to deceive
thousands of you young people tonight by
promising you that if you&rsquo;ll only follow him
and serve him and bow down to him and live
for him that he will give you freedom, life,
and liberty.</p>
<p>But actually, he gives you sorrow, slavery,
and eternal death in hell.</p>
<p>Now the devil is resisted in the Bible by the
characters of the Bible that God honored and
blessed and loved.</p>
<ul>
<li>He was resisted by Job.</li>
<li>He was resisted by Jesus.</li>
<li>He was resisted by the disciples.</li>
</ul>
<p>He was cast out of heaven and the Bible says
he will eventually and ultimately be cast
into hell, the lake of fire that was prepared
for the devil and his angels.</p>
<p>Now you say how did the devil originate? Why
did God allow the devil? Well, there&rsquo;s a lot
of uncertainty about that.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul calls evil the <code>mystery of iniquity</code>. There are just some things we don&rsquo;t
know. God did not reveal it to us, and if God
did not reveal it to us, we shouldn&rsquo;t be
delving into speculation, but there are some
hints in the Bible about where the devil
originated: in Isaiah the 14th chapter.</p>

<p>In other words, there came a time somewhere
back in eternity when Lucifer, the highest and
the greatest of all the created beings, led a
rebellion against God and it seems that about
a third of the angels joined him in the
rebellion. They were cast out of heaven. They
landed on this earth. And the devil and these
fallen angels who have now become demons are
active on this planet. They‚Äôre under
judgment. They‚Äôve been defeated by the cross
and the resurrection. They are ultimately
going to be cast into hell, but in the
meantime, they are active and increasing their
activity.</p>
<p>Now the sin of Lucifer was pride. He wanted to
be like god. He wanted to be above God. He
wanted to be the greatest being in all the
universe. So he led the rebellion. You say,
‚ÄúWhere did he get this idea?‚Äù We don‚Äôt know.
We don‚Äôt know how the sin entered his heart.
We don‚Äôt know why God allowed it. We don‚Äôt
know. This is wrapped up in the mystery of
God. It‚Äôs wrapped up in the <code>mystery of iniquity</code>.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs something we don‚Äôt understand, and it
will never be resolved until the battle of
Armageddon, when our Lord Jesus Christ is
going to come back, followed by thousands of
the armies of heaven, and He‚Äôs going to
destroy forever the devil and his angels, and
we‚Äôll be rid on this planet of the greatest
plague in the greatest thing that has ever
happened to any planet anywhere in the
universe.</p>
<h3 id="vexation-by-demons">Vexation by demons</h3>
<p>Now the second thing about demons the New
Testament makes one thing clear, there is one
evil there are many demons.</p>
<p>You remember the story in the fifth chapter
of Mark? The man of the gathering? This man
was possessed of a devil many demons and it
had affected his mental, emotional, and
physical faculties and he and Jesus held
conversation not with the man but with the
demons.</p>
<p>Jesus never talked to the man at all.</p>
<p>He talked to the demons, and there are
several things about that man that interest
me today and are irrelevant at this hour in
America.</p>
<p>He was naked. He was a streaker. He was
violent, and look at the violence in
the country.</p>
<p>He wanted the demons to be cast or the demons
wanted to be cast into the swine, into the
pigs you see the combination you have here?
You have violence, nakedness, self-
destruction, and pigs.</p>
<p>What do some of the people call the police
today? (Some of the more violent people)
Pigs.</p>
<p>Is there a connection? I don&rsquo;t know, but it&rsquo;s
quite interesting that this demon-possessed
man that Jesus encountered would have all of
those things that we&rsquo;re wrestling with today.</p>
<p>Now the origin of demons as I said a moment
ago is unclear.</p>
<p>Jesus said, &ldquo;I beheld Satan as lightning fall
from heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bible says in Revelation 12:</p>

<p>You say, &ldquo;What about exorcism?&rdquo; Well, do you know
what the word &ldquo;exorcism&rdquo; actually means? It means
&ldquo;expelling spirits by a religious act or religious
service.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s how it works, expelling an evil
spirit.</p>
<p>Jesus of course was the greatest of all
exorcists.</p>
<p>He commanded the demons and the forces of
evil to come out of people, and that man that
I was telling about a moment ago, he
commanded this legion of demons to leave, and
they left, and went into the swine, and the
swine went hurtling into the sea, and
destroyed themselves.</p>
<p>Now the fact of exorcism is a reality but it
is misunderstood.</p>
<p>Modern interpretations originated actually in
pagan practices, magic formulas, and rituals
to expel evil spirits, have been practiced
for centuries in primitive societies, usually
accompanied by violence and infliction of
pain.</p>
<p>There is one tribe in India that I read about
where they take a cotton wick soaked in oil
and they light it and they stuff it up the
nostrils of the person who is supposed to be
possessed of demons, and the cruelty of
professional exorcists in many parts of the
world is beyond our comprehension and
understanding.</p>
<p>Now Matthew the eighth chapter tells us that
when the disciples brought to Jesus many who
were possessed with demons, he cast out the
spirits not by means of a long ceremony, as
we are being told today, but by a word.</p>
<p>And his disciples cast out demons in the name
of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>How in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ are
those that have believed in my name, they
shall cast out demons.</p>
<p>There are some things,
however, that you should be aware of.</p>
<p>You should not go around claiming to cast out
demons in the name of Jesus Christ if you are
not sure that it is all right to do so.</p>
<p>You must be filled with the Holy Spirit, and
you must be walking in the Spirit, and you
must know that the one you are casting out is
a demon.</p>
<p>And you must know beyond the shadow of a doubt
that you have the authority of God&rsquo;s Word
behind you. Behind the name of Jesus stands
the power of almighty God.</p>
<h3 id="the-hold-of-sin">The hold of sin</h3>
<p>Now how do you keep from being possessed or
harassed and vexed by demons? You see demons
have power only that is as far as a Christian
is concerned.</p>
<p>Only when you are walking in some sin if you
allow a besides besetting sin to get a grip
on you you&rsquo;ve opened the way for the demons
in your life.</p>
<p>As we walk with Christ if you&rsquo;re a Christian
and you&rsquo;re walking in the spirit and God is
with you and all known sin has been confessed
and you&rsquo;re in fellowship with Christ then you
can walk in the middle of the most dangerous
spiritual situations and be protected by God.</p>
<p>You can claim authority over the devil and
his angels.</p>
<p>But I‚Äôll tell you what the devil will do,
he‚Äôll bluff as far as he can, he‚Äôll take all
the ground that you give him, give him an
inch, he‚Äôll take a foot.</p>
<p>A woman possessed of the spirit of divination
you remember bothered Paul in Philippi, and
he said to her, &ldquo;I command you in the name of
Jesus Christ to come out of her.&rdquo; And the
spirit came out, and she became well again.</p>
<p>Now I personally have had that experience a
few times but very few, and I was trying to
think, only once in America, I remember twice
in India, I remember once in Africa, and twice
in the Far East, and on each occasion, very
interestingly, the person involved used the
same three words: &ldquo;I am free.&rdquo; Christ can free
you, but it&rsquo;s not done with a ritual; it&rsquo;s not
done with the way it&rsquo;s being depicted.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s done in the name of the Lord Jesus
Christ, and every believer, every Christian
has the right to pray that prayer with a
person who is in trouble.</p>
<p>Now a great many things that we call demon
possession and not demon possession at all,
for example mental problems are not caused by
demons; many are not, and so you have to have
discernment that only the Holy Spirit can
give you as to what is demon activity and
what is normal activity or the activity of
nature.</p>
<p>You say, &ldquo;Well how do we overcome demons when
they bother us and harass us?&rdquo; I want you to
listen to this.</p>
<p>First of all, be sure you know Christ; I
don&rsquo;t believe that a true believer in Jesus
Christ can be possessed by a demon.</p>
<p>You can be vexed by a demon; you can be
harassed by a demon, but I don&rsquo;t believe the
Scripture teaches that you can be possessed
by a demon.</p>
<p>There are many things that
we call demon possession and not demon

Christ can be possessed by a demon.</p>
<p>You can be vexed by a demon, you can be
harassed by a demon, but I do not believe the
Scripture teaches that you can be possessed
by a demon.</p>
<h3 id="the-holy-spirit">The Holy Spirit</h3>
<p>Now Satan filled Judas, Satan filled Ananias
and Sapphira, who were professing believers,
we&rsquo;re told in scripture, but are you sure
that you know Christ? Do you know that Jesus
Christ lives in your heart? Have you settled
it? Come to Christ tonight while you can, as
Bill Cepeda said he did five years ago, as
Mike said he did three years ago, come to
Christ, surrender your life to him, and make
sure about that.</p>
<p>You will have a power living in you that is
greater than he that is in the world, you
will have the power of the Holy Spirit, the
power of God in your life, and you can resist
the devil, the Bible says, and he will flee
from you.</p>
<p>The second thing: be filled with the Holy
Spirit.</p>
<p>The scripture says be not drunk with wine but
be filled with the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>I want to ask you tonight, as a believer, are
you filled with the Holy Spirit? You can be
filled.</p>
<p>Not through some emotional ecstasy, you can
be filled by a simple act of faith.</p>
<p>How did you receive Christ? You received him
simply by faith, all right? You&rsquo;re filled the
same way.</p>
<p>You can say, &ldquo;I am filled by the Holy Spirit
with the Holy Spirit by faith.</p>
<p>You see, the moment you receive Christ, the
Holy Spirit takes up residence in your heart
and as you surrender everything that he
points out that is wrong in your life then he
fills you and you&rsquo;re filled and you produce
fruit.</p>
<p>Now, every Christian has the gifts of the
Spirit.</p>
<p>You have a gift; I don&rsquo;t care who you are and
how lowly a Christian you are; you have a
gift and you ought to be utilizing that gift
in the body of Christ and you ought to be
utilizing that gift in witnessing for Christ.</p>
<p>But the fruit of the Spirit is something
different.</p>
<p>The fruit of the Spirit is different than the
gifts of the Spirit.</p>
<p>The fruit of the Spirit is produced by the
Holy Spirit: love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
gentleness, goodness, and so forth.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s produced by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Now if you&rsquo;re living in the spirit producing
the fruit of the spirit, filled with the Holy
Spirit, Satan cannot get inside of you at
all, but let me tell you, sin even the
slightest little sin will grieve the Holy
Spirit and open the way for demonic activity.</p>
<p>Jesus said I will never leave you nor desert
you. I will not forsake you.</p>
<h3 id="the-armor-of-god">The armor of God</h3>
<p>Now the third thing, watch for the schemes of
the devil.</p>
<p>The scripture says put on the whole armor of
God that you may be able to stand against the
schemes of the devil.</p>
<p>Now the devil is going to exploit your
personality quirks, the lust of the flesh,
the natural physical drives that you have,
hunger, as he did Jesus.</p>
<p>He tempted Jesus when Jesus was hungry. The
devil always comes to you when you&rsquo;re weak to
tempt you to harass you to trouble you.</p>
<p>Watch out for those moments when you&rsquo;re weak
when you&rsquo;re hungry.</p>
<p>He also uses the sex drive, sex is a powerful
drive that we all have, and the devil will
use it if we give him a half an inch.</p>
<p>For our struggle the scripture says is not
against flesh and blood but against the
rulers, powers, forces of this dark world,
and the spiritual forces of wickedness in the
heavenly places.</p>
<p>And the scripture says: &ldquo;Therefore take up
the full armor of God, that you may be able
to resist in the evil day, and having done
everything, to stand firm.&rdquo; And &ldquo;the Bible
outlines the full armor that we should have
and I want to ask you tonight if you have
yours on, have you checked it? First, check it.</p>
<h3 id="the-belt-of-truth">The Belt of Truth</h3>
<p>When Paul was in jail in Rome under house
arrest, he had a Roman guard watching him.</p>
<p>Paul noticed how the belt of the guard&rsquo;s
uniform held together his uniform, so Paul
used the belt in his illustration (belt of truth) of how
Christians are to be &ldquo;girded up in the
truth&rdquo;, i.e., have the Scriptures, the Word
of God, inside their hearts.</p>
<p>In other words, learn the scriptures, learn
the word of God.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reason when people come forward to
receive the Lord&rsquo;s Supper we give them a
Bible study and we get them involved in the
scriptures.</p>
<p>Reading the scriptures, memorizing the
scriptures, this is how we resist the devil.</p>
<p>When Jesus Christ was tempted by the devil,
what did he do? He didn&rsquo;t argue with the
devil.</p>
<p>He resisted the devil by quoting scripture.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all he did, just quote scripture.</p>
<p>He said it is written, and when he was
finished quoting the scripture, the devil
would leave him, and angels would come and
minister to him.</p>
<h3 id="the-breastplate-of-righteousness">The Breastplate of Righteousness</h3>
<p>Paul said, &ldquo;Put on the breastplate of
righteousness.&rdquo; Now the breastplate was made
of bronze, backed with tough pieces of hide,
and the breastplate of righteousness is what
we get from Jesus Christ when we come to Him
as our Lord and Savior, because our
righteousness, our goodness, is filthy rags
in the sight of God.</p>
<p>So you need a righteousness that has been
provided for you, and it was provided for you
by Jesus Christ on the cross, and we receive
the breastplate of righteousness so that when
the devil shoots his fiery darts, they can&rsquo;t
penetrate that breastplate.</p>
<h3 id="shoes-with-the-preparation-of-the-gospel-of-peace">Shoes with the preparation of the gospel of peace</h3>
<p>And thirdly, he says how about your boots,
having your feet shod with the preparation of
the gospel of peace. Now that doesn&rsquo;t mean to
go out and just preach the gospel, it means
more than that, it means that you should have
the peace of God in your heart, the serenity,
the joy, the happiness that Christ gives,
should be in your heart, so that when
troubles come, Satan will not be able to get
close to you.</p>
<p>You see, Satan uses worry, anxiety, and
tension to keep us off balance. Are you
afraid? Do not fear; for I am with you; says
God. Do not anxiously look about you, for I
am your God. &ldquo;I will strengthen you; surely I
will uphold you with my right hand&rdquo;, says God
in Isaiah 41.</p>

<h3 id="shield-of-faith">Shield of Faith</h3>
<p>Are you worried about inflation/Covid19? Everyone&rsquo;s
bills are stacking up; the pressures of
business closing in; children getting out of
hand.</p>
<p>Those are the things you&rsquo;re worried about,
right? The scripture says, &ldquo;Be anxious for
nothing, but in everything, by prayer and
supplication with thanksgiving, let your
requests be made known to God, and the peace
of God, which surpasses all comprehension
will guard your hearts and your minds in
Christ Jesus,&rdquo; and then, what about the
shield the Roman soldiers carried? The
scripture says: in addition to all, taking up
the shield of faith, with which you will be
able to extinguish all the flaming missiles
of the evil one.</p>
<p>Now, Roman&rsquo;s shield was two feet wide and
four feet long and it warded off the blows of
the enemy.</p>
<p>He would hide behind it when arrows would
come against him.</p>
<p>Satan is always shooting his missiles and his
darts at us and we need the
shield of faith; Trusting and
believing in God, taking God at his word.</p>
<h3 id="helmet-of-salvation">Helmet of Salvation</h3>
<p>And then fifthly is the helmet, and take the
helmet of salvation, the helmet is very
important because it guards the brain,
protects the head.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot in the scripture to say about
the mind.</p>
<p>Let this mind be in you which was in Christ
Jesus, that will keep him in perfect peace,
whose mind is stayed on thee, intellectually.</p>
<p>You cannot come to Christ alone, because your
mind has a veil over it put there but the
devil.</p>
<p>But when you come to Christ, your mind is
illuminated by the Holy Spirit, and the
things that you didn&rsquo;t understand before, you
now accept by faith, and you put on the
helmet, and that helmet protects you against
the enemy.</p>
<p>The devil is going to try to cause you to
doubt. He&rsquo;s going to try to cause you to
question.</p>
<h3 id="freedom-from-sin">Freedom from sin</h3>
<p>I remember my own father.</p>
<p>He had been told by a preacher many years ago
that he had committed the unpardonable sin
and my father thought all those years that he
couldn&rsquo;t come to Christ.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t even know what it was and it was
years later that he found the joy of his
salvation again, you see Satan had
sidetracked and perverted the scriptures.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the sword and the sword of
the Spirit, which is the Word of God; that&rsquo;s
the offensive weapon, you see.</p>
<p>A Roman&rsquo;s blade was about 24 inches long, and
he would twist and turn, keep his balance,
always thrusting and the Scripture says that
the Word of God is living and active and
sharper than any two-edged sword.</p>
<p>When Satan tempted Jesus, Jesus used the
sword (the Word of God).</p>
<h3 id="persecution-of-the-righteous">Persecution of the righteous</h3>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reason it&rsquo;s important to study the
Bible, to know the Bible, to learn the Bible
and I believe this: that Christians and
believers are going to go through a period of
trouble and difficulty.</p>
<p>We may go to jail. We may be killed for our
faith as many people in other parts of the
world have been. We&rsquo;re not going to escape
it. It&rsquo;s on the way.</p>
<p>And the way to get prepared is to learn this
book so that when they do call upon you to
witness, when they do call upon you, you know
the scriptures and you can quote the word of
God and be a witness and resist the devil.</p>
<p>And the scripture says, he will flee and then
the seventh and the last thing is to pray.</p>
<p>Prayer without ceasing said Paul.</p>
<p>With all prayer and petition, pray at all
times in the spirit, praying in Bible study.</p>
<p>Check that your armor is in place, one final
word: the final victory, the victory of the
Lord Jesus Christ, the destruction of the
Devil and his works and death and hell in the
grave have been nullified; they have been
destroyed by the Lord Jesus Christ at the cross, the
victory is won; that victory is assured; till
that final day there is a lot of suffering, a
lot of fighting, a lot of battling; but we
are on the winning side; and the scripture
teaches that Jesus Christ has won the
victory, and they overcame him by the blood
of the Lamb; by the blood of the Lamb; there
is power in the blood.</p>

    The word mystery denotes something hidden

    it.

Mystery of iniquity
Secret power of lawlessness
    [mystery]

    (2 Thessalonians 2:)

    The working of lawlessness in the world,
    leading to a worldwide rebellion against
    God.

    It is a mystery that is being restrained
    from being revealed.

    The revelation of this lawlessness will
    coincide with the revelation of the
    Antichrist.

Doctrine of the Gentile church

    25 Now to him who is able to establish you
    in accordance with my gospel, the message
    I proclaim about Jesus Christ, in keeping
    with the revelation of the mystery hidden
    for long ages past, 26 but now revealed
    and made known through the prophetic
    writings by the command of the eternal
    God, so that all the Gentiles might come
    to the obedience that comes from[a] faith‚Äî
    27 to the only wise God be glory forever
    through Jesus Christ! Amen.

<p>The mystery revealed to Paul &ldquo;that the
Gentiles should be fellowheirs and of the same
body and partakers of his promise in Christ by
the Gospel&rdquo; (Ephesians 3:3-6).</p>
<p>That the saved Gentiles became fellowheirs
with saved Jews, and were united then in
Christ through the Gospel is the obvious
teaching of Paul in Ephesians 3, a proposition
upon which all will agree</p>

<h2 id="the-mystery-of-iniquity">The mystery of iniquity</h2>
<p>It works in secret right now, but it is
working.</p>
<p>The man of sin‚Äôs rise to power will represent
a climax of lawlessness, a satanic movement
against the administration of God.</p>
<p>This secret, behind-the-scenes movement is as
yet restrained but waiting to be revealed.</p>
<p>The mystery of iniquity has been at work for a
long time‚Äîsince Paul‚Äôs day‚Äîand, when it
finally erupts in all its hideousness, the
world will be shaken to its core.</p>
<p>The Antichrist, who leads the descent into
lawlessness, will set a new standard of
depravity.</p>
<p>The enormity of the acts of moral monsters
such as Stalin, Hitler, Pol Pot, Idi Amin,
Robespierre, and Caligula will pale in
comparison to the evil of the Antichrist.</p>
